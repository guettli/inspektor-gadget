  Verify Inspektor Gadget release assets
---

The Inspektor Gadget release checksums file is signed using [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign).
In this guide, we will see how you can verify release assets with this tool.

## Verifying the checksums file

You would need to have `cosign` [v2.0](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/README.md#developer-installation) installed to verify the checksums file:

```bash
$ RELEASE='v0.16.0'
$ ASSET="SHA256SUMS"
$ URL="https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/releases/download/${RELEASE}"
# We need to get the asset itself, its signature file and the corresponding bundle:
$ for i in $URL/$ASSET $URL/$ASSET.sig $URL/$ASSET.bundle; do
	wget $i
done
...
# We need to get the public key too.
$ wget $URL/inspektor-gadget.pub
...
$ cosign verify-blob $ASSET --bundle ${ASSET}.bundle --signature ${ASSET}.sig --key inspektor-gadget.pub --offline
Verified OK
```

As you can see, the checksum file was correctly verified which means this file was indeed signed by us.
So, you can use this file to verify other release assets.

## Verify an asset

Once you verified the checksums file, you can now verify the integrity of an asset using such checksums file:

```bash
$ RELEASE='v0.16.0'
$ ASSET="inspektor-gadget-${RELEASE}.yaml"
$ URL="https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/releases/download/${RELEASE}"
$ wget $URL/$ASSET
$ grep $ASSET SHA256SUMS | shasum -a 256 -c -s || echo "Error: ${ASSET} didn't pass the checksum verification. You must not use it!"
```
